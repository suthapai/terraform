Terraform is a tool for infrastructure provisioning to build out infrastructure through code, often called Infrastructure as Code. So, Terraform allows you to automate and manage your infrastructure, your platform and your services that run on that platform. It's open source and declarative, which means you define WHAT you want (the desired "end state") rather then describing exactly each step or HOW to do it.
